Go HTML Info
===

Go HTML Info provides a simple interface to extract meaningful information from an html page.

source docs: http://godoc.org/github.com/dyatlov/go-htmlinfo/htmlinfo

Install: `go get github.com/dyatlov/go-htmlinfo/htmlinfo`

Use: `import "github.com/dyatlov/go-htmlinfo/htmlinfo"`

`Parse` method parses all html content into structurized ata.
`GenerateOembedFor` method generate oembed info from that structurized data. It generates that info based on available data, even if no oembed information found on the page.

Example:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/dyatlov/go-htmlinfo/htmlinfo"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()
	u := "http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/02/365-days-10-million-3-rounds-2-companies-all-with-5-magic-slides/"

	resp, err := http.Get(u)

	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	defer resp.Body.Close()

	info := htmlinfo.NewHTMLInfo()
	info.AllowOembedFetching = true

	ct := resp.Header.Get("Content-Type")

	// if url and contentType are not provided it's fine too, just then we wont be able to fetch (and generate) oembed information
	err = info.ParseWithContext(ctx, resp.Body, &u, &ct)

	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Info:\n%s\n", info)

	fmt.Printf("Oembed information: %s\n", info.GenerateOembedFor(u))
}
```

Result would be:

If you’re wondering when you can get your hands on it, and how much it will cost, here you go: Apple says the iPad Pro and related accessories will be available in November.\nPricing will start at $799 with 32 gigabytes of memory and WiFi-only connectivity, with a $949 price tag for 128 GB, and $1,079 for 128 GB and a cellular connection. If you want the company’s new stylus, dubbed the Apple Pencil, that’ll cost you $99, and the Smart Keyboard will cost $169.\nThat may seem pretty pricey compared to other iPads — in fact, Apple said today that it’s dropping pricing on its iPad Mini 2, which its considers to be the entry-level iPad, to $269. What you’re paying for (among other things) is a 12.9-inch screen with resolution of 2,732 x 2,048 pixels, Apple’s A9X chip and four speakers.\nAnd, as the name and on-stage demos suggest, Apple seems to be pitching this for enterprise use and productivity, not for casual use.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSay Hello To The Brand-New iPad Pro\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
